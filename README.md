💎Hi! My name is A'Kia, a self-taught Data Analyst and marketing ethusiast💎
___
I'm an MBA graduate in digital marketing and while I love creating marketing strategies I absolutley love organizing the data to create those strategies and visualizations. 
This is how I found myself completing the Google Data Analytics Cert. Which led me to want to get more involved with the data side of marketing.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on completeing Danny Ma's 8 week SQL Challenge
- 🌱 I’m in the process of learning Python
- ✨ I love learning new things - from making homemade bread to automating processes in multiple ways
- 📝 I organize EVERYTHING in life via Excel- travel, accounts, monthly goals, events, etc.
